      <p>My name is Maite Rivas and I was born and raised in Venezuela for the majority of my life. I have been living in the United States for a very long time, making me fluent in both English and Spanish.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am enrolled in Northwestern University's Data Science and Visualization Boot Camp, which has allowed me to learn a multitude of programming languages thus far. I am very detail and numbers-oriented, which is partly why I decided Data Science would be a good fit for me. I feel that it allows me to take my love for numbers and apply it in a future role that includes visualization and organization of large datasets. I am really looking forward to being able to apply my knowledge outside of the classroom.</p>
